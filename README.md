#  IBM Applied Data Science Capstone: SpaceX Launch Prediction Project

### Predicting SpaceX First Stage Landings with Data Science  
*A real-world capstone project integrating data collection, wrangling, visualization, and machine learning.*


##  Project Background & Motivation

**SpaceX** has transformed space technology by introducing reusable rockets, significantly reducing launch costs. For example, the **Falcon 9** rocket, priced at ~$62 million per launch, is considerably cheaper than competitors due to its reusable first stage.

Accurately predicting landing success can optimize mission planning, reduce risk, and help manage costs. This project aims to explore **whether the Falcon 9 first stage will land successfully** using historical launch data.

##  Research Objectives

- How do variables like **payload mass**, **launch site**, **orbit type**, and **flight number** influence landing success?
- Has the **rate of successful landings** improved over time?
- Which **machine learning algorithm** best predicts binary landing outcomes (success/failure)?

## âš™ Methodology

###  Data Collection
- Collected SpaceX launch data using the **SpaceX REST API**
- Scraped additional information from **Wikipedia**

###  Data Wrangling
- Filtered, cleaned, and merged datasets
- Handled missing values and duplicates
- Applied **One-Hot Encoding** for categorical variables

###  Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualized trends using **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**, and **SQL**
- Performed in-depth exploration of launch sites, payload distribution, and success rates

###  Interactive Analytics
- Developed **Folium** maps to show global launch site distribution and proximity analysis
- Built a **Plotly Dash dashboard** with interactive components to explore data dynamically

###  Predictive Modeling
- Trained and evaluated multiple classification models:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
  - Decision Tree
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Performed **GridSearchCV** for hyperparameter tuning
- Selected the best-performing model based on **accuracy and confusion matrix**
